<IntroParagraph large>
  Tamagui makes cross-platform apps with fully shared code much easier and faster.
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui goes deeper than any other style library at achieving high performance across every platform by outputting to platform-native primitives and its optimizing compiler. It gives a huge amount of features that are all fully typed and 100% supported across every platform, letting you write inline styles that feel great and don't slow your app down.

In the two years since 1.0, Tamagui has gone from a rough-around-the-edges ambitious project, to a robust, stable and widely adopted solution that is improved in every possible way.

We've added many, many things, some highlights include:

- Core styling features like container queries, container + media queries, and platform and theme selectors.
- New compound components like Tabs, Accordion, and ToggleGroup.
- We made all our compoennts have unstyled versions, so you can more easily style them how you like.
- We released a free visual Theme builder that lets you build incredibly diverse looks.
- We launched our Takeout starter kit, and Bento copy-paste components and patterns.

But we've also spent a lot of time just improving the fundamentals. We had a lot of feedback that Tamagui docs were lacking, and that it was hard to install and configure. So, we focused on those areas a lot, and landed nearly a thousand commits just improving that. If you haven't checked out Tamagui since closer to 1.0, you'll find a lot has gotten better:

- We imrpoved and open sourced our package build script `@tamagui/build`, which makes it so all of Tamagui requires no special bundler set up at all. That's right - whether using Metro, Vite, or Webpack, you can just install any Tamagui package and use it without touching your bundler.
- We upgraded `@tamagui/config` continuously, and with the new version 4, made it incredibly easy to BYO colors while still starting quickly with little fuss.
- We landed over 500 commits improving documentation.

Version 2 doesn't have many breaking changes. Instead it removes a few deprecated things that were holding us back from some more ambitious projects we want to take on going forward.

What has changed on a high level:

- Button and ListItem have new versions that are simplified and faster.
- Removed the `space` and `spaceDirection` props in favor of gap.
- Moved the `<Spacer />` component from core into `@tamagui/spacer`.
- Removed the deprecated `StyledComponent.extractable`.
- Moved all settings on `createTamagui` onto the `settings` object.
